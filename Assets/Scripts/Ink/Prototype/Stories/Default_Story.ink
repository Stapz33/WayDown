        Always enjoying a nice drink in every good place of this town. #otherCharacter
        Especially when our famous investigator is in there... #otherCharacter
        Only wanted to have a drink with you, that's all! #otherCharacter
        This would be a first time since I work for the family. #player
*   [What a coincidence!] How odd it is to find you here! Are you also keeping an eye on me? #player
        Why are you saying it like that? Why can't I only come for a friendly drink with you? #otherCharacter
        Cause you never did so since I work for the family? #player
-   I see... Let's say that it's a friendly drink between two workers in the family. #otherCharacter
#jump
*   [What do you want?] So what do you want from me Mr <color=red>Morello</color>? #player
-   Only for you to find what happened to <color=red>Giovanni</color>, like anyone else. #otherCharacter
    It's a great blow to our organization, and something needs to be done. #otherCharacter
    I'm not usually advising for a power showdown, but now we need to be tough. #otherCharacter
#jump
*   [Is the family that weak?] Is the Italian mob in so much trouble. #player
        We're not. But no one takes on the family. #otherCharacter
*   [Strange choice from you] I would not have thought that you would be the one advising for the strong method. #player
        I would not in normal times, but now we need to show that nobody can attack us. #otherCharacter
-   How can you be so sure that it is the work of someone else? #player
    And not only a hookup that went amiss? #player
    That's really not the type of <color=red>Giovanni</color>. #otherCharacter
    He was key to our organization. #otherCharacter
    We worked closely on a business together. #otherCharacter
#jump
*   [What was it?] What was this company? #player
-   Castelbueno Oil Company. #otherCharacter
    There's always oil somewhere with Italians... #player
    It's just something for the family to pour money into. #otherCharacter
    Actually, we had very little to do with <color=red>Giovanni</color>. #otherCharacter
    And even less money for ourselves. #otherCharacter
    So why would he be targeted? #player
    Because he was the future. #otherCharacter
    The bright young face of the family. #otherCharacter
    Maybe someone that would bury us all. #otherCharacter
#jump

    Try to find who wants to harm us. #otherCharacter
    What else would I try to find? #player
    I don't know, but remember who's paying you Bugsy. #otherCharacter

    Once upon a time, a man fell for a cute Irish prostitute.#player
    But seeing that she was not really receptive, he followed her.#player
    And saw her being 'friendly' with another.#player

    I paid the Condor to have her for the whole night, but then after half an hour, he came to the door.#otherCharacter

    Can't believe it, the Condor used to be more serious!#otherCharacter
#jump

-   Didn't have the time to ask! #otherCharacter
    He took her by the arm, but she didn't seem to want to go with him.#otherCharacter

    Geez... #player

So you see that letter that we found at Giovanni's apartment?#player
I first thought it was from a woman.#player
Turns out it had the same handwriting as the note that we found on the killer's body.#player
It makes sense that whoever wrote that letter, also saw the killer, and possibly asked him to kill Giovanni.#player

It's the same on that business card...#player

Bugsy Rosenthal, private eye, what can I do for you?#player #NewCharacterSprite #7
Really professionnal Bugsy, that's surprising.#otherCharacter
Jesus Lanza, not you again...#player
Don't say that, you'll miss me.#otherCharacter
What do you want?#player
Just wanted to thank you. You really pulled this off.#otherCharacter
I hate to say this, but you saved us on this.#otherCharacter
Otherwise we would have been in a really ugly war.#otherCharacter
I think those methods are better left in the past.#otherCharacter
Anyway, I'll stop following you from now.#otherCharacter
You can go back to sleep, I won't bother you at 3AM from now.

So we meet one last time it seems, Bugsy.#otherCharacter #PlayerDBox #0
Indeed. I got you.#player
I know. And to be honest, I'm kinda relieved.#otherCharacter
You won't get out of this.#player
Yes, without any doubt.#otherCharacter
But it was quite a life.#otherCharacter
Life of murder?#player
No, it was the first time for me.#otherCharacter
Why Giovanni then?#player
I think that you know it.#otherCharacter
I loved him.#otherCharacter
I still do.#otherCharacter
He asked me to change the administration decision about sending him in prison to save Lima.#otherCharacter
But I couldn't, it would draw too much suspicion over us.#otherCharacter
So he threatened to go public about our relation.#otherCharacter
I couldn't let him do that.#otherCharacter
How is this situation relieving then? You got caught.#player
Because I had to hid. I felt like a prey, never able to live my life.#otherCharacter
Now it doesn't matter.#otherCharacter
I only hope that Giovanni will forgive me.#otherCharacter

How disappointing...#otherCharacter
You're just a drunk, tired, and useless man.#otherCharacter

So it was Jimmy...#otherCharacter
It seems so.#player
Alright, that's all I needed.#otherCharacter
What a waste...#otherCharacter
Go back home Bugsy. You won't have to see such a disgrace.#otherCharacter #PlayerDBox #1
