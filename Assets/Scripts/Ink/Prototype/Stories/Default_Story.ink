        Always enjoying a nice drink in every good place of this town. #otherCharacter
        Especially when our famous investigator is in there... #otherCharacter
        Only wanted to have a drink with you, that's all! #otherCharacter
        This would be a first time since I work for the family. #player
*   [What a coincidence!] How odd it is to find you here! Are you also keeping an eye on me? #player
        Why are you saying it like that? Why can't I only come for a friendly drink with you? #otherCharacter
        Cause you never did so since I work for the family? #player
-   I see... Let's say that it's a friendly drink between two workers in the family. #otherCharacter
#jump
*   [What do you want?] So what do you want from me Mr <color=red>Morello</color>? #player
-   Only for you to find what happened to <color=red>Giovanni</color>, like anyone else. #otherCharacter
    It's a great blow to our organization, and something needs to be made. #otherCharacter
    I'm not usually advising for a power showdown, but now we need to be tough. #otherCharacter
#jump
*   [Is the family that weak?] Is the Italian mob in so much trouble. #player
        We're not. But no one takes on the family. #otherCharacter
*   [Strange choice from you] I would not have thought that you would be the one advising for the strong method. #player
        I would not in normal times, but now we need to show that nobody can attack us. #otherCharacter
-   How can you be so sure that it is the work of someone else? #player
    And not only a hookup that went amiss? #player
    That's really not the type of <color=red>Giovanni</color>. #otherCharacter
    He was key to our organization. #otherCharacter
    We worked closely on a business together. #otherCharacter
#jump
*   [What was it?] What was this company? #player
-   Castelbueno Oil Company. #otherCharacter
    There's always oil somewhere with Italians... #player
    It's just something for the family to pour money into. #otherCharacter
    Actually, we had very little to do with <color=red>Giovanni</color>. #otherCharacter
    And even less money for ourselves. #otherCharacter
    So why would he be targeted? #player
    Because he was the future. #otherCharacter
    The bright young face of the family. #otherCharacter
    Maybe someone that would bury us all. #otherCharacter
#jump
*   [A threat?] Maybe a threat then? #player
-   More like a renewed family. #otherCharacter
    But anyway, now we'll try to repair that. #otherCharacter
#jump
*   [What's the name of the company?] What's the name of the company again? #player
    Castelbueno Oil Company. #otherCharacter
    Here, take a card. #otherCharacter #NewDocument #5
    But don't expect to order any oil from it. #otherCharacter 
-   I'll leave you now. #otherCharacter
    Try to find who whants to harm us. #otherCharacter
    What else would I try to find? #player
    I don't know, but remember who's paying you Bugsy. #otherCharacter
    Then we'll be grateful, and know how to show it. #otherCharacter
    Goodbye then, until next time. #otherCharacter

    Once upon a time, a man fell for cute Irish prostitute.#player

    I paid the Condor to have her for the all night, but then after half an hour, he came to the door.#otherCharacter

    He took her by the arm, but she didn't seem to want to go with him.#otherCharacter
